# About Me

## Introduction

Hi! I’m Monte Gardiner, an undergraduate student at Brigham Young University majoring in Statistics and Data Science. I’m especially interested in applied data science, statistical modeling, and building practical tools that turn data into actionable insights. I enjoy working at the intersection of analytics, technology, and real-world decision making.

I’m currently focused on developing strong foundations in statistical theory while applying those skills through hands-on projects in data analysis, machine learning, and software development.
